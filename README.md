# dotfiles
Dotfiles for my vim and tmux configs.

Clone the repo and run `install.sh` to install Pathogen, some vim plugins, and my dotfiles for vim and tmux.
Run `uninstall.sh` to remove the vim plugins and to revert the dotfiles to backups saved when the dotfiles were installed.

## Plugins added:
* NERDTree (File explorer)
* gruvbox (Colorscheme)
* vim-airline (Status bar)

## tmux settings:
* Set prefix to C-a
* Split panes like vim (v and s)
* Select panes using C-a(hjkl)
* Resize panes using M-(hjlk)
* Shift-arrow to switch windows
